# Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation
Rachel “Ray” Hsiao | DH 110: User Experience and Design | Fall 2022

## Tentative title: seagood seafood
I’ve always liked learning more about the natural world, and I developed an interest in marine conservation through participating in the National Ocean Sciences Bowl academic competition in high school. I don’t have many opportunities to explore this through my major, so when I saw “Life Under Water” was one of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, I was excited to choose it. 

I thought of focusing on seafood because overfishing is by far the greatest danger to marine organism populations. I want to help people make sustainable choices when they are out shopping for seafood to cook. I remember that the Monterey Bay Aquarium had an activity in which you guess which seafood option is the best for the environment, so I knew that tools with similar goals to mine already existed. 

I will conduct a heuristic evaluation of two such websites in this assignment using usability heuristics and severity ratings.

### [10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)
| # | Heuristic | Description |
| - | - | - |
| 1 | Visibility of system status | Inform user what is happening and provide feedback for actions |
| 2 | Match between system and the real world | Design |
| 3 | User control and freedom | Allow users to make mistakes and undo and redo actions easily |
| 4 | Consistency and standards | Design based on well-known standards and to have internal consistency |
| 5 | Error prevention | Reduce likelihood user makes mistake |
| 6 | Recognition rather than recall | Provide references for user to reduce cognitive load |
| 7 | Flexibility and efficiency of use | Provide several avenues to complete the same task |
| 8 | Aesthetic and minimalist design | Focus design around what is relevant to the user |
| 9 | Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors | Identify problems and how to solve them |
| 10 | Help and documentation | Provide information to help user complete task (ideally not needed) |

### [Severity Ratings for Usability Problems](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/)
| Rating | Description |
| - | - |
| 1 | Cosmetic problem, fix only if time allows for it |
| 2 | Minor usability problem, low priority |
| 3 | Major usability problem, high priority |


## Competitor 1: [Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch](https://www.seafoodwatch.org/)
My first competitor site is [Seafood Watch](https://www.seafoodwatch.org/), a sustainable seafood advisory list with a search feature. It is a program run by the Monterey Bay Aquarium that reviews the impact of fisheries and aquaculture on marine and freshwater ecosystems todevelop a scoring called the Seafood Watch Recommendation.

The home page displays the search feature prominently.

Using the search feature takes the user to the Recommendations page. Users can filter their searches with criteria like species, harvest method, country/region, body of water, and recommendation level.

Due to the design of the entries, it is difficult to distinguish how entries are different. Additionally, only a couple entries can be displayed at once, making it even more difficult to cross reference them. What’s worse, Seafood Watch’s app support got discontinued so mobile users must use the browser website on their phones, which shows even less information per viewport.

Clicking on an entry takes the user to a page with additional details, including the Seafood Watch Recommendation score.

### Heuristic Evaluation

#### 1. Visibility of System Status

**Evalution:** What tab you're on is indicated by a blue line at the bottom of the associated button in the menu bar. However, this is not very apparent since the line is not very thick and blends in with the webpage below.\
**Recommendation:** Change the entire button to blue so it obviously contrasts with the other buttons in the menu bar.\
**Severity level:** 1

**Evalution:** The website displays a loading circle icon after the user clicks something.\
**Recommendation:** The color of the loading icon doesn't match the prominent colors on the site, so I would change it to one of those colors instead.\
**Severity level:** 1
